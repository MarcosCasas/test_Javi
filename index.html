        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Cooking has been a passion for me since I was 10 years old. When I arrived home from school,<br/> 
            I used to cook lunch for my mother as she was working hard and getting home quite late.
        </p>
        <p>With the time, that duty became a passion, which led me to enroll the Hotel and Catering School at Cadiz,<br/> 
        where I had the chance of meeting real passionate and professional teachers, whose knowledge was only surpassed by their kindness.
        </p>
